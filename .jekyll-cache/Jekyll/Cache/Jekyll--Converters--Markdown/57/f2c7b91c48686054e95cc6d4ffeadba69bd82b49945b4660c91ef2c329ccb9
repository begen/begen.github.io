I"G<p>In this tutorial, we will be working with Amazon SageMaker to build, train and deploy a machine learning model using XGBoost algorithm.</p>

<p>We will be working with a bank dataset and we will try to predict whether a customer will enroll for a certificate of deposit or CD.</p>

<p>In order to work, we need to have AWS account.</p>

<p>We will follow following steps: 1) Create a notebook 2) Prepare our data 3) Train the model to learn from the training dataset 4) Deploy the model 5) Evaluate performance</p>

<p>Once you login to AWS SageMaker, create instance of a notebook, IAM role and select S3 bucket.</p>

<p>In Jupyter, create a new conda_python3 notebook.</p>

<p>Below code imports the required libraries amd defines environmental variables needed to prepare the data, train the ML Model, and deploy the ML Model.
