I"<p>In this tutorial, we will be working with Amazon SageMaker to build, train and deploy a machine learning model using XGBoost algorithm.

We will be working with a bank dataset and we will try to predict whether a customer will enroll for a certificate of deposit or CD.

In order to work, we need to have AWS account.

We will follow following steps: 1) Create a notebook 2) Prepare our data 3) Train the model to learn from the training dataset 4) Deploy the model 5) Evaluate performance

Once you login to AWS SageMaker, create instance of a notebook, IAM role and select S3 bucket.

In Jupyter, create a new conda_python3 notebook.

Below code imports the required libraries amd defines environmental variables needed to prepare the data, train the ML Model, and deploy the ML Model.
