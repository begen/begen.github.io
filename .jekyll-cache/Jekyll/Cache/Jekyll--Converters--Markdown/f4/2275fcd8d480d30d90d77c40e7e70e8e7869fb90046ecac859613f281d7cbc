I"Á<p>Here in this project, we will be discovering new insights on diabetes dataset. We really hope our findings will be helpful. We have diagnostic measurements such as pregnancy, glucose level, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin, BMI, Diabetes Pedigree Function (DPF) that gives some information on risk level related to hereditary and age. We will be building a model that predicts whether patient has diabetes based on those measurements.</p>
