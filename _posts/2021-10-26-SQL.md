We will be performing some SQL 

    select *
    from CovidDeath
    order by 3,4

    select *
    from CovidVaccinations
    order by 3,4

Select data that we are going to be using

    select location,date,total_cases,new_cases,total_deaths,population
    from CovidDeath
    order by 1,2

looking at Total cases vs Total Deaths. Also percentage of dying in countries

    select location,date,total_cases,total_deaths, (cast(total_deaths as float)/cast(total_cases as float))*100 as DeathPCT
    from CovidDeath
    where location like '%states%'
    order by 1,2

Looking at total cases vs population

    select location,date,population,total_cases, (cast(total_cases as float))/cast(population as float)*100 as DeathPCTPOP
    from CovidDeath
    where location like '%united states%'


Breaking down by continent

    select continent,max(cast(total_deaths as int)) as TotalDeathCount
    from CovidDeath
    --where location like '%united states%'
    where continent is not null
    group by continent
    order by TotalDeathCount desc

Show Countries with Highest Death Count Per Population

    select location,max(cast(total_deaths as int)) as TotalDeathCount
    from CovidDeath
    --where location like '%united states%'
    group by location
    order by TotalDeathCount desc

Global numbers

--1

    select  sum(new_cases) as total_cases, sum(cast(new_deaths as int)) as total_death, sum(cast(new_deaths as float ))/sum(cast(New_Cases as float ))*100 as DeathPCT
    from CovidDeath
    where continent is not null
    group by date
    order by 1,2


--2

Show Countries with Highest Death Count

    select location,max(cast(new_deaths as int)) as TotalDeathCount
    from CovidDeath
    where location like '%united states%'
    where continent is null
    and location not in ('World','European Union','International')
    group by location
    order by TotalDeathCount desc

--3

    Countries with highest infection rates
    select location,population,max(total_cases) as HighestInfectionCount, max((cast( total_cases as float))/cast(population as float))*100 as PctPopInfected
    from CovidDeath
    --where location like '%united states%'
    group by location, population
    order by PctPopInfected desc


-- 4 

    select location,population,date, max(cast(total_cases as float)) as HighestInfectionCount, max((cast( total_cases as float))/cast(population as float))*100 as PctPopInfected
    from CovidDeath
    --where location like '%united states%'
    group by location, population,date
    order by PctPopInfected desc


-- Looking at total population vs vaccinations

    select dea.continent,dea.location,dea.date,dea.population, cast(vac.new_vaccinations as integer)
    ,sum(vac.new_vaccinations) over (partition by dea.location order by dea.location,dea.date) as RollingPeopleVaccinated

    from CovidDeath dea
    join CovidVaccinations vac
        on dea.location=vac.location
        and dea.date=vac.date
    where dea.continent is not null
    order by 2,3
