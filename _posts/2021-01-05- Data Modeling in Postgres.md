# Project: Data Modeling with Postgres


## Introduction
Startup team Sparkify wants to analyze data on a new music streaming app. The team particularly interested in understanding of what songs its app users listening to. Currently data resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app and directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app. There is no ETL pipeline that would extract data for analysis purposes.

The task for a data engineer is to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis. Data engineers role is to create a database schema and ETL pipeline for their analysis. 


## Project description

Task: 
1) define fact and dimension tables for a star schema for a particular analytic focus
2) write ETL pipleline that transfer data from files in two local directories into these tables in Postgres using Python and SQL 

## Song Dataset
Sparkify team has an access to subset of a real data from Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format with metadata about a song and the artist of that song. 

Below is our filepath for our two files in the dataset: 
    song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
    song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
    
Below is an example of what a single song file in JSON format look like: 
    {"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}

## Log Dataset
Second dataset is a log file in JSON format generated by the even simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. Those log files are partitioned by the year and month and filepath for those two files are: 

    log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
    log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json

## Project Instructions

In order to start our analysis, we first need to create a STAR SCHEMA that is optimized for queries.
