Using measure, we can perform most powerful data analysis. This measures help us to perform calculation on our data and results can be diplayed on dashboards. 

Below, average rating has been calcualted taking into consideration ratings of employees. 


    Average Rating = AVERAGE('cassendra reviews'[RATING])


    Count of RATING average per RATING = 
    AVERAGEX(
        KEEPFILTERS(VALUES('cassendra reviews'[RATING])),
        CALCULATE(DISTINCTCOUNT('cassendra reviews'[RATING]))
    )
